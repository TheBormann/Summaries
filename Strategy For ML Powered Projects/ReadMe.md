# Strategy For ML Powered Projects

!!Disclamer!!
This summary his highly based on the book [Building Machine Learning Powered Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/)
I can highly recommend it to read it yourself.

This is a basic ml project workflow:
1.  Understand the big picture
2.  Get Data
3.  Visualize data and get more insight
4.  Optimize the data
5.  Train model
6.  Improve model
7.  Present solution (can be similar to data visualization)
8.  Make it production ready
