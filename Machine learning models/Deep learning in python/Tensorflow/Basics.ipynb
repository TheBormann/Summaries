    "(FOR TENSORFLOW 2.1.* use this command to work: pip install tensorflow-estimator==2.1.*)\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "TensorFlow has a highly active community and evolves very rapidly, so to stay up to date read the documentation:\n",
    "https://www.tensorflow.org/install\n",
    "\n",
    "But for my purposes it's best to install tensorflow via Anaconda.\n",
    "Anaconda is a packet manager for Python that has all packages needed for data science.\n",
    "To install Tensorflow via Anaconda [click here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/)\n",
    "or type in your terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# for GPU support\n",
    "conda create -n tf-gpu tensorflow-gpu\n",
    "conda activate tf-gpu\n",
    "\n",
    "# only CPU\n",
    "conda create -n tf tensorflow\n",
    "conda activate tf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use TensorFlow with GPU\n",
    "The standard for Tensorflow is, to use the GPU when available. You can change this if you want.\n",
    "There is only a small catch: GPU support is currently only available on Ubuntu and windows systems with CUDA graphic cards.\n",
    "This means we need an workaround for graphic cards that doesn't use cuda\n",
